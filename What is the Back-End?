What is the Back-End?

    The front-end of a website or application consists of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets sent to a client, like a web browser.
    A web server is a process running on a computer somewhere that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses.
    Storing, accessing, and manipulating data is a large part of a web application’s back-end
    Data is stored in databases which can be relational databases or NoSQL databases.
    The server-side of a web application, sometimes called the application server, handles important tasks such as authorization and authentication.
    The back-end of web application often has a web API which is a way of interacting with an application’s data through HTTP requests and responses.
    Together the technologies used to build the front-end and back-end of a web application are known as the stack, and many different languages and frameworks can be used to build a robust back-end.
